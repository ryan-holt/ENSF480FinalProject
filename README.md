# ENSF480FinalProject

### Current Task: Due November 8th

* In this phase you should submit a Design Document that includes a clear description of systemâ€™s requirements,
and design artefacts in the following order:
    
    * Systems use case diagram
    * Systems activity diagram 
    * A state transition diagram for each of the following objects in your system:
        
        * Property object
        * Process that landlord posts his/her property
    
    * System interaction diagrams for each use case. You only should draw a new use-case diagram if a use
    case introduces a new object. This will be discussed in the class. (Sequence Diagram like the ATM example)
    * A design level detailed class specifications that includes:
    
        * A class diagram without attributes and behavior that only shows the class name and the
    relationships among them. The purpose of this diagram is to show the entire system in one page.
    Please make sure lines never cross each other and the diagram is clear and easy to read.
        * A class diagram with no relationships (no lines), only showing the class details: attributes and
behaviours. This diagram can be organized in multiple pages. Please try to keep them well
organized, clear, and easy to read.
        * A state transition diagram for at least two major and core classes in the system
    
    * A package diagram
    * A deployment diagram

Note: In this stage you need to apply all possible design strategies and techniques to make the architecture of
the system more: reusable, scalable, maintainable, reliable, and using necessary concepts such as modular
design, inheritance, realization, aggregation, composition, polymorphism, and appropriate design patterns as
needed.
